# CyperPunkMatrixSol
This is a simple "App" that can solve the cyperpunk matrix puzzle, using image processing.
Just take a couple of pictures and let the app do the rest (very simple brute force algorythem).

## installation
`pod install` and you're good to go :D 

## usage
it's all in the app.
There's one catch; you need to crop the picture to contain only the relevant data (Matrix | sequences).
